   sample/DEMO_Procedure_Display/Flight_Plan_Display_and_Creation.py: Shows how to create a flight plan with example going from SFO to PHX. 
   sample/DEMO_Procedure_Display/NATS_header.py: This module contains all the frontmatter that has to be inserted in any given NATS Client program. 
   sample/DEMO_Procedure_Display/PlotHelpers.py: Used for plotting procedures. It has a bunch of routines using matplotlib libraries. 
   sample/DEMO_Procedure_Display/PostProcessor.py:  It is the visualization and post processing module for NATS simulations. It takes in MC simulation results and produces histograms and plots for state variables.
   sample/DEMO_Procedure_Display/ProcedureDisplay.py: This is the backend that handles the display of procedures using displayProcs.py module. 

3. sample/DEMO_XPlane/XPlane_NATS_Integration_Client_beta1.2.py: The client code that reads data from a live X-Plane flight simulation, and feeds it into NATS for trajectory generation. This sample code can be used for extending real time simulation from other simulators as well.

4. sample/basic_python_example_beta1.2.py: This program runs a basic simulation of NATS for a given flight plan.

19. sample/SampleMonteCarloSafetyMetrics.m: MATLAB program of Monte Carlo simulation by changing safety metrics. It plots out the graph showing crucial flight parameters after simulation runs through.

20. sample/PathVisualizer.py: This python module is a helper function to plot trajectories on Google Map after the simulation goes through. Pre-requisite for this is Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser.

21. sample/DEMO_UI_TaxiRouteGenerator/arv_taxiplan_example.py: This example illustrates how to use NATS functions of airport interfaces.
    sample/DEMO_UI_TaxiRouteGenerator/dep_taxiplan_example.py: This example illustrates how to use NATS functions for plotting airport layout and
