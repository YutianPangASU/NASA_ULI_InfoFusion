National Airspace Trajectory-Prediction System(NATS)

Version: beta 1.2

Changes in this release:

1. Fixed the simulation logic handling different aircraft departure times.

2. Handled sessions between NATS Server and Client
   Programs on client side have to execute function
       natsClient.disConnect()
   in order to end the connection with server.

3. New feature of "Conflict Detection and Resolution"

4. New feature of strategic and tactical weather avoidance
   Strategic weather avoidance requires at least 12GB RAM to have good performance result.  Servers with small size of RAM may experience long period of execution due to Linux's swap partition I/O.

5. Safety Metrics Interface Added.

6. Controller Error Model Added.

7. Individual Monte Carlo Simulation modules in Python and MATLAB have been added for Pilot, Controller, and SafetyMetrics Interfaces.
